  "overview": {
    "basic": "For pirates, the code is more what you'd call 'guidelines' than actual rules. Pirate Fluxx starts simple — draw a card, play a card. The cards, however, change the rules, take dastardly actions, and even change the way you win!\n Can you find victory on the ever-changing tides? Prepare your best (or worst!) pirate accent, and find out who's the captain of this ship... for now."
