    "basic": "In a corrupt, futuristic world, a group of 5â€“10 saboteurs team up to bring down the self-serving government. Recent intelligence has suggested, however, that some of these saboteurs are secretly government loyalists. Who can you trust?\nThe Resistance pits a small number of secret defectors against the rest of the group, requiring them to fail missions without raising suspicion. Will you successfully topple the corrupt government, or will you ohm-erwhelm the resistance as the cunning spies?"
