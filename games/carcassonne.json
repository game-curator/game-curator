      "basic": "It's time to summon your inner town-planner. During a game of Carcassonne, you'll draw tiles and place them on the board, aiming to finish features such as roads, monasteries and cities. Every time you have a follower on a finished feature, you'll earn points, working your way towards victory.\nBe cautious though — you have a limited number of followers, and you only get them back when something's finished. Beware of your 'buddies' — given the chance, they might just try to eliminate the competition!"

Also included are a number of unusual tiles, including tiles with the risky inns and cathedrals — a road with an inn attached, or a city containing a cathedral, is worth double the points... if you finish it. Fail to finish it, and you get nothing.\nFinally, there's a new follower added — the \"big meeple\" is worth two followers, so you might just be able to muscle someone else out of those hard-earned points!"
