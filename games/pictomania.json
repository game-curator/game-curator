    "basic": "In Pictomania each player is assigned a word to draw. Your goal is to guess the other players’ words while drawing your own. That’s right: Everyone is drawing and guessing simultaneously! No one has time to draw a complex masterpiece. The player who can sketch the essence of a word with a few lines will have more time to figure out the other players’ drawings.\n The simple scoring system rewards you for a drawing that is easy to guess as well as for guesses made quickly and accurately. But regardless of your score, you are certain to get a laugh out of your fellow players’ drawings..."
