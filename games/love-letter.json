Enlist the aid of the 15 ladies and gentlemen of the royal court, passing it from person to person until it reaches the Princess herself!\nEach player holds a secret card, and on their turn, draws another, choosing to discard one and play its effect. Be quick, though, because once the cards are exhausted, only the letter closest to the Princess will be read!"
