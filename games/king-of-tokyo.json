In order to win the game, one must either destroy Tokyo by accumulating 20 victory points, or be the only surviving monster once the fighting has ended."

What's more, each monster comes with its own set of eight Evolution cards so that each monster can mutate into an even more nightmarish version of itself!\n King of Tokyo: Halloween also includes twelve new Power cards to be shuffled into the deck. These cards are all Costumes, a new type of card that provides a powerful effect, but which can be stolen by any monster that rolls three claws and rips the costume off of you."
