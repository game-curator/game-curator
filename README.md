Game Curator
============

This is the beginning of a serverless version of Game Curator, coming with
proper release mechanisms.

TODO
----

* [ ] Auto TravisCI builds again
* [ ] Host via GitHub pages
* [ ] Rebuild game catalog
* [ ] Add "automatic" contribution method
* [ ] Flesh out this documentation
* [ ] Allow for multiple themes/accept contributions
* [ ] Extend game schema to allow for BGG metadata, and game expansions
* [ ] Release 1.0
* [ ] Mayhaps experiment with an Electron version (but unlikely to add value?)
