Invoke the old Djinns and move the Tribes into position, and the Sultanate may just be yours!\nBid to go first in a race to take the best moves. Carefully plot a course to move the tribes, claim lands for your own, and gain allies from the Assassins, Elders, Merchants, Builders and Viziers, and invoke mighty Djinns to your cause."
